# JS-GreenScreenAlgorithm
Green Screen Program. Replaces green pixels with alternative pixels.

<h3>Green Screen algorithm website</h3>
Takes two different images, the first one being a foreground image, with a green background. And the second image being the image that you want to use for the foreground image's background. It then replaces the green pixels in the foreground image for the same pixels in background images.

Extremely basic, did it for the 'Duke Learn to Program' JS Course, using their library.

It works only with a green background of which each pixel has a rgb value of (Green>Red+Blue), and it is meant for two images of the same size, although it could work otherwise, just not as intended.
